# HelloApp

Hello App starts with Hello World, progresses to displaying a user name, then names from command-line args and standard input. It then manages names in a collection with list/remove options, refactors into methods and classes, adds persistence across runs, and finally displays names in banner format.

# Use Case Roadmap

The Hello App evolves step by step from a fixed console message to a modular, persistent, and extensible application.

```
UC1: Print a basic greeting in the console.

UC2: Accept one name via command-line input and greet that user.

UC3: Support optional argument handling with a default greeting path.

UC4: Handle multiple command-line names in one execution.

UC5: Read a single name from standard input.

UC6: Read and process multiple names from standard input.

UC7: Store entered names in memory and list them on request.

UC8: Add removal support for stored names.

UC9: Extract input-processing logic into dedicated methods.

UC10: Move name-management responsibilities into a separate class.

UC11: Persist names to storage and reload them across runs.

UC12: Render greeting text in banner-style output for enhanced display.
```

This sequence demonstrates progression from core syntax and I/O to collection handling, clean architecture, and persistence.
